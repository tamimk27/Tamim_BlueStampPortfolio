# Project Name Here
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:

For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE



# Second Milestone

**Don't forget to replace the text below with the embedding for your milestone video. Go to Youtube, click Share -> Embed, and copy and paste the code to replace what's below.**

For my second milestone I worked on using the IR remote that the kit came with and having it control where the tank goes. I managed to accomplish this by programming it in which I looked at the examples that was given from the documentation in which it shows how the motors goes and it also provided the hexadecimals for the inputs on the remote. With those inputs I had saved them into a variable and made if statements for if this button was pressed it would go this certain way. What was surprising to me is that there was a data type that I wasn't aware of which I had to use for the inputs which was long as it is for hexadecimals as those are huge numbers to store. Besides that, another challenge I had to deal with was with my motor screw being loose with one of the wheels but I managed get that fixed just fine as it seemed that I didn't do it correctly while assemblying it. For my next milestone I hope to work with the LED panel and also have that respond to inputs just like the motors.

# First Milestone

For my first milestone I worked on assembling the parts together and verifying that uploading code works fine for when I do work on modifications later. With the tank being built with motors and boards like the arduino and keeping them all together with screws and bolts assembling the tank itself was easy but it did take some time. One of the reason why it took some time would have be like the tank treads in which they were shown on the assembly video from the company to be easy to put on but for me it took some force to put it on. Outside of that issue I managed to assemble it just fine and I had verified that I can upload code by testing the example code for the led and motor control project to see if they would actually work and they did. For my next steps I hope to use the motors control on my IR remote so I can make it move whereever and have it stop. 

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
